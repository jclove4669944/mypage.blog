		<h4>Benson Boone</h4>
	<p>
	[Verse 1]
	If I could count the stupid things I do for you<br>
	Oh, just for a taste (Mhm)<br>
	I'd make it to a million just to realize<br>
	It was all just a chase<br>
	Oh, what a waste<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	[Pre-Chorus]<br>
	And now, I hope you know what you've done<br>
	I won't be here when you're running back<br>
	'Cause you don't have anyone<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	[Chorus]<br>
	Oh, I bet you think your honey tastes like sugar<br>
	But honey, sugar don't taste that bitter<br>
	Baby, you ain't sweet<br>
	Look at what you did to me<br>
	Oh, I bet you money that you'll look back later<br>
	But baby, money won't make this better<br>
	Baby, love ain't cheap<br>
	Look at what you did to me<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	[Post-Chorus]<br>
	Look at what you did<br>
	Look at what you did<br>
	See upcoming pop shows<br>
	Get tickets for your favorite artists<br>

	<p>
	</p>
	[Verse 2]<p>
	Silver chains and promise rings<br>
	Never really meant a thing, did they? (Oh, no-oh)<br>
	Was everything you did just a front?<br>
	To get the things that you really want from me?<br>
	(You wouldn't do that, would you?)<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	[Pre-Chorus]<br>
	And now, I hope you know what you've done<br>
	I won't be here when you're running back<br>
	'Cause you don't have anyone<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	[Chorus]<br>
	Oh, I bet you think your honey tastes like sugar<br>
	But honey, sugar don't taste that bitter<br>
	Baby, you ain't sweet<br>
	Look at what you did to me<br>
	Oh, I bet you money that you'll look back later<br>
	But baby, money won't make this better<br>
	Baby, love ain't cheap<br>
	Look at what you did to me<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	[Bridge]<br>
	Ooh, look what you did to me, baby<br>
	Look what you did to me, baby, uh<br>
	Ooh, look what you did to me, baby<br>
	Look what you did to me, baby<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	[Chorus]<br>
	Oh, I bet you think your honey tastes like sugar<br>
	But honey, sugar don't taste that bitter<br>
	Baby, you ain't sweet<br>
	Look at what you did to me (What you're doing to me)<br>
	Oh, I bet you money that you'll look back later<br>
	But baby, money won't make this better<br>
	Baby, love ain't cheap<br>

		<h2 id="title2">Too Sweet</2>
		<h4>Hozier</h4>
	<p>
	It can't be said I'm an early bird<br>
	It's ten o'clock before I say a word<br>
	Baby, I can never tell<br>
	How do you sleep so well?<br>
	</p><p>
	You keep telling me to live right<br>
	To go to bed before the daylight<br>
	But then you wake up for the sunrise<br>
	You know you don't gotta pretend, baby, now and then<br>
	</p><p>
	Don't you just wanna wake up, dark as a lake?<br>
	Smelling like a bonfire, lost in a haze?<br>
	If you're drunk on life, babe, I think it's great<br>
	But while in this world<br>
	</p><p>
	I think I'll take my whiskey neat<br>
	My coffee black and my bed at three<br>
	You're too sweet for me<br>
	You're too sweet for me<br>
	</p><p>
	I take my whiskey neat<br>
	My coffee black and my bed at three<br>
	You're too sweet for me<br>
	You're too sweet for me<br>
	</p><p>
	Ooh<br>
	Ooh<br>
	Ooh<br>
	Ooh<br>
	</p><p>
	I aim low<br>
	I aim true, and the ground's where I go<br>
	I work late, where I'm free from the phone<br>
	And the job gets done, but you worry some, I know<br>
	</p><p>
	But who wants to live forever, babe?<br>
	You treat your mouth as if it's Heaven's gate<br>
	The rest of you like you're the TSA<br>
	I wish I could go along, babe, don't get me wrong<br>
	</p><p>
	You know you're bright as the morning, as soft as the rain<br>
	Pretty as a vine, as sweet as a grape<br>
	If you can sit in a barrel, maybe I'll wait<br>
	Until that day<br>
	</p><p>
	I'd rather take my whiskey neat<br>
	My coffee black and my bed at three<br>
	You're too sweet for me<br>
	You're too sweet for me<br>
	</p><p>
	I take my whiskey neat<br>
	My coffee black and my bed at three<br>
	You're too sweet for me<br>
	You're too sweet for me<br>
	</p><p>
	Whoa, oh<br>
	Whoa, oh<br>
	Whoa, oh<br>
	Whoa, oh<br>
	</p><p>
	Whoa, oh<br>
	Whoa, oh<br>
	Whoa, oh<br>
	Whoa, oh<br>
	</p><p>
	I take my whiskey neat<br>
	My coffee black and my bed at three<br>
	You're too sweet for me<br>
	You're too sweet for me<br>
